# Budget Buddy 
Budget Buddy is a handy tool to help you take control of your spending. Built using React Native, this on-the-go expense tracker can works on both Android and iOS!  


## Supports Zero-Sum Budgeting 
Budget buddy makes creating a budget and tracking your progress easy. 
* Define your own spending categories, each with their own spending limits and time periods
* Log your expenses against these categories 
* View your budgeted vs actual spending across different time periods, allowing you to easily see where your money is going 

### Why is this needed? 
The key problem Budget Buddy addresses is tracking your spending expenses with different regularity. If you're logging your expenses and viewing a summary for the week, irregular expenses like a car service can make it seem like you're massively over budget. 

By defining your own views and category time periods, you can group your expenses by their regularity and make more sense of your spending.
